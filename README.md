# Artificial Intelligence
#### MIT OCW 6.034

I find artificial intelligince and machine learning really interesting, so I decided to follow [this MIT OpenCourseWare course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/) by Prof. Patrick Henry Winston. I'm watching the video-lectures, doing the readings from the text, and completing the labs. These are the labs.

Labs:

0) Python programming, symbolic algebra

1) Forward chaining, backward chaining and goal trees

2) Search, using heuristics, optimal search, graph heuristics

3) Game search

4) Constraint satisfaction problems, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees

5) Neural nets, boosting
